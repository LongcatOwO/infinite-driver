# Infinite Driver Things

Project hosted at https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/hitchicris/infinite-driver

## Building

This project uses recent C++ library and language features and so needs an up-to-date compiler. On Linux that's the last couple versions of `clang` and `gcc`; on Mac that's `llvm` from Homebrew (installed into `/opt` as CMake is set to look for the stdlib there, see CMakelists.txt line 173-176)
